    "\n",
    "Hello everyone, this assignment notebook covers Tree-Based Models. There are some code-completion tasks and question-answering tasks in this answer sheet. For code completion tasks, please write down your answer (i.e., your lines of code) between sentences that \"Your code starts here\" and \"Your code ends here\". The space between these two lines does not reflect the required or expected lines of code. For answers in plain text, you can refer to [this Markdown guide](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-ultimate-markdown-guide-for-jupyter-notebook-d5e5abf728fd) to customize the layout (although it shouldn't be needed).\n",

    "**Important:** \n",
    "* Rename and save this Jupyter notebook as **cs5228_a3_YourName_YourNUSNETID.ipynb** (e.g., **cs5228_a3_BobSmith_e12345678.ipynb**) before submission!\n",

    "* Submission deadline is Oct 26, 11.59 pm. Late submissions will be penalized by 10% for each additional day. Failure to appropriately rename both files will yield a penalty of 1 Point. There is no need to use you full name if its a rather long; it's just  important to easily identify you in Canvas etc.\n",

    "## 2 Implementing a AdaBoost with Decision Stumps (30 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple base learners to improve overall classification performance. In AdaBoost, the base learners are typically weak learners, which are models that perform slightly better than random guessing (e.g., Decision Stumps). Here's a brief overview of how AdaBoost works using Decision Trees as base learners for classification tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Initialization:** Assign equal weights to all training samples. These weights determine the importance of each sample in the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Iterative Phase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Base Learner Training:* Train a base learner (usually a Decision Stump) on the training data. It tries to minimize the weighted classification error, giving more weight to misclassified samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Weighted Error Calculation:* Calculate the weighted classification error of the base learner. This error is the sum of the weights of misclassified samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Classifier Weight Calculation:* Assign a weight to the base learner based on its performance. The better the performance, the higher the weight. This weight is used to determine the contribution of the base learner's prediction in the final ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Update Sample Weights:* Increase the weights of misclassified samples so that they become more important in the next iteration. This focuses the subsequent base learners on the samples that are harder to classify correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Ensemble Building:* Combine the predictions of all base learners, weighted by their individual classifier weights, to obtain the final ensemble prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Final Prediction:** The final prediction is made by aggregating the weighted predictions of all base learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost's strength lies in its ability to focus on the difficult-to-classify examples, allowing it to improve performance even with weak base learners. This makes it particularly effective in situations where a single base learner might struggle. Keep in mind that while AdaBoost is powerful, it's important to be cautious about overfitting. AdaBoost can overfit if the base learners are too complex or if the number of iterations is too high. Therefore, it's advisable to monitor the performance on a validation set and potentially use techniques like early stopping or limiting the complexity of base learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your last task will be to implement an AdaBoost Classifier using Decision Stumps as covered in the lecture. But not to worry, this may only sound more difficult than it actually is, and we will guide you through this process step by step. We also keep things simple by assuming that all input features are numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, we can split the implementation into 2 subtasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Weak Learner:** You first implement the simplest \"Decision Stump Classifier\", i.e., a Decision Tree with only one split and therefore a height of 1. This means we do not have to care about the recursive splitting of nodes; it's not complicated but would only add tedious coding.\n",
    "* **AdaBoost:** With the Decision Stump Classifier in place, you can implement AdaBoost as shown in the lecture."

The skeleton code of method `fit()` allows you to focus on the core steps within each iteration for training the next Weak Learner (here, our Decision Stump).

To make this change, just use the commented line under Step 1 to train the Weak Learner.\n",

    "\n",
    "As the last step, we now only need our AdaBoost classifier to predict the class labels for unseen data samples. Again, we saw in the lecture how this works: For each data sample, we check which of the `n_estimators` estimators predicts a certain class label, and the sum of all the alphas (i.e., the amounts of say) of the estimators of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skeleton code of the `AdaBoostTreeClassifier` already provides a method `predict()` which takes a list of data samples as input and calls the method `predict_sample()` to predict the class label for each data sample individually. It's not that difficult to do this completely vectorized without the loop over the data samples, but here we want to focus on the basic algorithm and not worry about performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implement method predict_sample()** to predict the class label for a given data sample. Hint: Have again a look at [np.argwhere](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argwhere.html) to maybe make your life easier. You can use the example calls below to test your implementation of the method."

    "In this last part, we look into evaluation different tree-based models using k-fold cross validationa. K-fold cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to assess the performance and generalization ability of a model. It involves dividing the dataset into K subsets (or \"folds\") of equal size. The model is trained on K-1 of these folds and tested on the remaining one. This process is repeated K times, with each fold used as the test set exactly once. The final performance metric is computed by averaging the results from each iteration. K-fold cross-validation helps ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting or underfitting.\n",
