    "Hello everyone, this assignment notebook covers Tree-Based Models. There are some code-completion tasks and question-answering tasks in this answer sheet. For code completion tasks, please write down your answer (i.e., your lines of code) between sentences that \"Your code starts here\" and \"Your code ends here\". The space between these two lines does not reflect the required or expected lines of code. For answers in plain text, you can refer to [this Markdown guide](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-ultimate-markdown-guide-for-jupyter-notebook-d5e5abf728fd) to customize the layout (although it shouldn't be needed).\n",

    "## 2 Implementing a AdaBoost with Decision Stumps (30 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple base learners to improve overall classification performance. In AdaBoost, the base learners are typically weak learners, which are models that perform slightly better than random guessing (e.g., Decision Stumps). Here's a brief overview of how AdaBoost works using Decision Trees as base learners for classification tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Initialization:** Assign equal weights to all training samples. These weights determine the importance of each sample in the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Iterative Phase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Base Learner Training:* Train a base learner (usually a Decision Stump) on the training data. It tries to minimize the weighted classification error, giving more weight to misclassified samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Weighted Error Calculation:* Calculate the weighted classification error of the base learner. This error is the sum of the weights of misclassified samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Classifier Weight Calculation:* Assign a weight to the base learner based on its performance. The better the performance, the higher the weight. This weight is used to determine the contribution of the base learner's prediction in the final ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Update Sample Weights:* Increase the weights of misclassified samples so that they become more important in the next iteration. This focuses the subsequent base learners on the samples that are harder to classify correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Ensemble Building:* Combine the predictions of all base learners, weighted by their individual classifier weights, to obtain the final ensemble prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Final Prediction:** The final prediction is made by aggregating the weighted predictions of all base learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost's strength lies in its ability to focus on the difficult-to-classify examples, allowing it to improve performance even with weak base learners. This makes it particularly effective in situations where a single base learner might struggle. Keep in mind that while AdaBoost is powerful, it's important to be cautious about overfitting. AdaBoost can overfit if the base learners are too complex or if the number of iterations is too high. Therefore, it's advisable to monitor the performance on a validation set and potentially use techniques like early stopping or limiting the complexity of base learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your last task will be to implement an AdaBoost Classifier using Decision Stumps as covered in the lecture. But not to worry, this may only sound more difficult than it actually is, and we will guide you through this process step by step. We also keep things simple by assuming that all input features are numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, we can split the implementation into 2 subtasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Weak Learner:** You first implement the simplest \"Decision Stump Classifier\", i.e., a Decision Tree with only one split and therefore a height of 1. This means we do not have to care about the recursive splitting of nodes; it's not complicated but would only add tedious coding.\n",
    "* **AdaBoost:** With the Decision Stump Classifier in place, you can implement AdaBoost as shown in the lecture."

    "In the case of a regular decision tree we have seen that we need at-most only 8 splits to perfectly separate out each point ( i.e. training error of 0). In the case of my implementation AdaBoostTreeClassification, it has around 50 decision stump estimators each of which has a maximum depth of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since my Adaboost internally uses my DecisionStump implementation which tries to find out all possible thresholds across all features (which are just the x & y coordinate points in this case), it is fair to say that each decision stump given some data it might either choose to split this dataset either using a single \"horizontal line separator\" or single \"vertical line seperator\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost basically tries to re-classify misclassified entries of the previous estimator by ensuring that those datapoints are picked again (with replacement) in a probabilistic manner. This approach for this particular dataset has a high chance of giving a training error of 0 because we will keep trying to correctly classify all points once the previous estimator(s) chooses a particular split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each decision stump by itself cannot overfit the training data to give a training error of 0, the hope is that an ensemble of them together can correctly classify each point correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular dataset, here is how a sample adaboost fitting might work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimator 1: gives a vertical split between column 5 & 6 , classifying all points to the left as \"blue\" due to majority points being blue, and assigning all points to the right as \"red\" ( even though there are equal red and blue points)\n",
    "Estimator 2: It samples majority of the datapoints which were misclassified and comes up with another single split to try and reduce that error ( say a horizontal line in between row 3&4). Now the misclassified points from this are weighed again\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",

    "Estimator 50: Yet another single horizontal or vertical line is predicted based on the sampled datapoints using the weight of the previous estimator's misclassification weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we find all the splits, each of the 50 estimators have their own \"say\" values which can influence the final classification prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 50 is high enough number ( much greater than 7 or 8 for example which were the number of splits needed in a regular decision tree), it seems likely that the combination of all of these estimators should be able to correctly classify all points. Even in case 50 estimators does not do the trick, increasing the number estimators even further (say to 100) will definitely ensure that the training error can go to 0.\n",

Random forests however is not as sensitive to noise due to the higher reduction in variance achieved across its various decision stumps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",
    "| 2   | The error rate $\\epsilon_m$ of the Adaboost classifier always decreases from one iteration to the next. | False              | Even though Adaboost aims to \"boost\" the misclassified points, it may not always decrease the error rate from iteration to iteration. Since each estimator is a decision stump it might so be the case that the error rate increases slightly for this particular estimator even though we sample the datapoints from the weights of the previous estimator. Since this is also very sensitive to noise, it might stumble upon a particular outlier data point during one of the iterations with one of its estimators causing the error value to increase. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the error rate always decreases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

This means that up to 20% of the data samples have been misclassified | False              | Assuming we have 100 datapoints, in the first iteration all weights will be 1. Since error is calculated as the $\\Sigma_i^Nw_i.indicator_function(x_i)$ after 'm' iterations it might be the case that weights are a lot different where some points have more weight and other points have lesser weight. Therefore getting a value 0.2 with these new weights does not imply that upto 20% of the samples have been misclassified. If a point is repeatedly being misclassified it might have a high weight which contributes more to the error value of 0.2 so if he have such 'high' error datapoints we can get a value of 0.2 with a lot less number of misclassfied samples. A similar argument can be made on the other end of the spectrum as well as a lot of datapoints together could also contribute to the value of 0.2 in totality |\n",

This does not mean that the model will perform better on unseen data and is not indicative of its generalizability. It could also be the case that the model has learnt to predict even outliers correctly as the adaboost algorithm is sensitive to noise. This would mean that testing on unseen data actually leads to a worse performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |"

    "## 3 Evaluating Tree-Based Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last part, we look into evaluation different tree-based models using k-fold cross validationa. K-fold cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to assess the performance and generalization ability of a model. It involves dividing the dataset into K subsets (or \"folds\") of equal size. The model is trained on K-1 of these folds and tested on the remaining one. This process is repeated K times, with each fold used as the test set exactly once. The final performance metric is computed by averaging the results from each iteration. K-fold cross-validation helps ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting or underfitting.\n",
